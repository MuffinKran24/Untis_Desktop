# Untis on Desktop

âš  This is still work in progress and doesn't work as expected âš 


This is a desktop port for untis so you don't have to use the web version everytime

To use this programm you need to enter your credentials to log into untis

s = webuntis.Session(
    server='borys.webuntis.com',
    school='Your school',
    useragent='WebUntis Test',
    username='Your username',
    password='Your password'

(they are not saved. trust me ðŸ˜…)
